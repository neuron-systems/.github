* Network slicing (RAN/Core slicing orchestration)
* Latency-optimized slices (e.g., gaming slice PoCs)
* xApp/rApp concepts and near-real-time intelligence for RAN

### 🤖 **AI/ML for Network Intelligence**

* Network anomaly detection
* Dynamic policy optimization
* Predictive analytics for RAN/Core KPIs
* NWDAF-inspired architectures and prototypes

### 🏗️ **Cloud-Native Microservices**

* Go and C++ telecom microservices
* API gateways, mediation layers, and charging pipelines
* Kubernetes service mesh, operators, GitOps patterns

### ⚙️ **Simulation, Tooling & Developer Kits**

* 5G network setup toolkits
* Traffic generators and CDR simulators
* LLM-powered assistants for telecom and infra
* Engineering utilities for lab automation
